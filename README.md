# Data Structures Walkthrough

A full implementation of data structures in both Java and Javascript, along with tutorials.

Often, people neglect the foundations of data structures and algorithms, and instead focus on utilizing them in problem solving. However, understanding how structure works on the inside can be extremely helpful in being able to apply them in real solutions.

In this project, there will be full walkthroughs of each type of data structure, with full implementations of them in different languages.

## Java ![java-tested badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-tested-brightgreen.svg) ![codestyle badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/codestyle-google-blue.svg)

### Code Style

The code follows the [Google Java Style Guide](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/reports/google-java-style-20170228.html#s7.3-javadoc-where-required), with the XML checkstyle file found [here](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml).

In terms of [Javadoc](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/index-137868.html), the code includes `@precondition`, `@postconditions`, and `@param` tags for extra clarity and definition of methods, although not officially supported by Javadoc. `@precondition` and `@postconditions` both are in front of `@param` in terms of order, respectively.

### Current Data Structures

- [ ] Queue

## Javascript ![codestyle badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/codestyle-google-blue.svg)

Documentation follows the standards of [@use JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/tags-returns.html). The code includes `@precondition`, `@postconditions`, and `@param` tags for extra clarity and definition of methods, although not officially supported by @use JSDoc. `@precondition` and `@postconditions` both are in front of `@param` in terms of order, respectively.
